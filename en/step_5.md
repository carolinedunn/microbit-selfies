## Build the micro:bit trigger

- Connect a male-to-female jumper wire to GPIO pin `4` on your Raspberry Pi. 
- Take a crocodile clip cable and connect one end to the pad on your micro:bit labelled `0`, and another to the pin labelled `GND` or ground.
- Connect another cable to pin `1` and connect the other end to the male end of the jumper wire you used on your Raspberry Pi, like in the diagram below:

	Now that you have created your trigger circuit, you can boot your Raspberry Pi and load mu.
