## What next?

- Can you create a countdown on the micro:bit LED matrix before a photo is taken by the camera?
- Now that you have the camera taking one picture triggered by the micro:bit, how could you take more pictures and save them as separate files?
- Take a look at the [Getting started with micro:bit](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-microbit) resource for more things you could do with your micro:bit.
